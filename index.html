    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p> Progressive Enhancement is implied to be an important development, allowing developers to work with any browser they choose while still having their content published across all browser modes. Creating a website without browser limitations is very useful and will bring more audience because using only new browsers will limit the audience because not everyone can have the new browser. Additionally, the website will be created to fit in the browser content feed, which is good because it helps the developer improve their skills on the new web while also ensuring that everyone else is getting the same information and website regardless of what browser they are using.

    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection </h2>
    <p>For my first draft, I have asked a couple of my friends to critique and tell me their opinions about my draft. After hearing some of their comments, I also went and critiqued my work to see if I agree with their opinion or not because each person has their own style of creation. 

      The suggestion was mostly about the color, spacing, and font size which I agreed on. I decided to set a theme for my final draft which was a lot more helpful than being without a theme, I sketched my idea on my ipad then began working on my final and fixing it. 
      
      When I started fixing the suggestion, I began to have more fun and less stress working on the final rather than being stressed out while working on my draft. Realizing mistakes and taking others' advice can make things a lot smoother. 
      
      I was extremely worried about this course, I thought I wasnâ€™t going to enjoy and it will be hard on me but it was complete opposite, one of my favorite courses this semesters, learning was extremely fun mainly because you understand what the professor is teaching which helps you learn a lot better and easier, the projects and assignments all made sense and were doable on your own as well fun. 
      
      I think I did extremely well for a starter in my assignments, thought none of them are perfect but its the thoughts and process I put into it which I know I will become better at it with more practice but now HTML became a favorite language to me, sometimes it could get frustrating but its still fun, as well made me be interested in website development and creation.
